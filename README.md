# Solid 3D Engine: real-time object animation



## The 3D Engine


In March 2020 my country went into lockdown in response to the Covid-19 pandemic with all A-level examinations being subsequently cancelled. With now having a lot more time on my hands I decided to focus on a new programming project; one that would build upon what I'd learned from developing my original [Wireframe 3D Engine](https://tobiasloader.github.io/Wireframe-3D-Engine) in 2018.  Using linear algebra knowledge from my A-level further maths studies, my aim would be to design a more advanced engine that would be capable of rendering solid objects in real-time. In the same way that I developed the earlier engine I wanted to see how much I would be able to achieve through my own insight and ideas; without reference to external resources, libraries, etc.
